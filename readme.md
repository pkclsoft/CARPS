# CARPS - Computer Aided Role Playing System

This is a legacy project I started back in 1989 with a friend (who sadly, I've lost contact with).
The plan at the time was to write an RPG (ala the Ultima series) that was extensible, had multiple worlds, used procedural generation to generate those worlds from a seed, and supported (using a very object oriented methodology) the embellishment of those worlds with civilisations, etc.
Needless to say, we didn't get very far with it.
We had grand plans.  This repository is my way of preserving what we did write, which wasn't much.
All I've found thus far, is the beginnings of a basic sprite editor.  I had lost some of the code, and had to recreate it by disassembling a working binary using Apple's DumpObj tool
The repo comes with the code for a basic sprite mechanism, and a desktop application for creating and editing those sprites.  The application isn't quite feature complete.  I've had to tweak some of the code (on an GSPlus emulator) because the ORCA/Pascal compiler I have seems to do some strange things.
So it's probably not a lot of use, but it's a start of preserving some of my old code.
